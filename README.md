# Weather-Dashboard

## Descriptions:
This is a website that lets you know the weather in  your area. You are able to get the temperature, humidity and weather description. 

## User Story:
I need to create a website that can provide the weather to the city that I want to travel to. It will give you a 5 day forecast. 

## Table of Content
1. Main page where the user can enter a city from the United States.
2. The user presses on the button and the weather will display in two areas.
3. Once the button is pressed the city search will appear below where the user can check the weather again if needed. 
4. The user can refresh the page but the data stays logged in the searched history.
